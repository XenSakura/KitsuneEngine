# AngelBase
a 3d Vulkan game engine build from the ground up for multithreaded purposes with dedicated editors

## Building this project
This project uses CMake and is intended to be a cross-platform game engine, hence the use of cross-platform libraries such as Vulkan. 

Before building this project, make sure you have a version of the Vulkan SDK that can support 1.3 features or later.

To build this project, get the CMake-gui, and select the source directory as the root directory. Create a build folder, and use that to compile your builds. Solution files will be generated for each individual computer-- but general structure will remain the same across multiple computers.

## Use cases
This project is intended to be a commercial use engine. Contact project lead at [sakura.shih.1@gmail.com](mailto:sakura.shih.1@gmail.com).

## Style and coding contributions
Make sure to read STYLE.md before contributing! Following these rules is important for keeping compilation times low and using the safest features of C++!
